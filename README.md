# Curated bibliography for my drafts and articles

### Conventions:

- The references always have the form `<Name><YYYY><suffix>`, where `<Name>` is the last name of the first author, starting with a capital letter, `<YYYY>` is the year of publication, always using four digits, and `<suffix>` is an optional suffix consisting of only letters.
